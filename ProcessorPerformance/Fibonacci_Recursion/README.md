# **Fibonacci Numbers (or Hemachandra Numbers)**

D. E. Knuth writes: "Before Fibonacci wrote his work, the sequence F_{n} had already been
discussed by Indian scholars, who had long been interested in rhythmic patterns that are
formed from one-beat and two-beat notes. The number of such rhythms having n beats altogether
is F_{n+1}; therefore both GopƒÅla (before 1135) and Hemachandra (c. 1150) mentioned the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... explicitly." (source The Art of Computer Programming:
Fundamental algorithms Vol. 1, 2nd ed. by Donald Knuth).

# **Fibonacci: by Recursion**

If you played around with calculating Fibonacci Numbers by recursion, you might
have noticed that the bigger the argument (or number) you provide, the longer the function
takes to run. Furthermore, the run time increases very quickly. On one of our machines,
fib(20) finishes instantly, fib(30) takes about a second, and fib(40) takes like a minute.

The following figure shows the so-called **recursion tree** corresponding to an execution of `fib(6)`:

![fib(6)](https://github.com/sigmakappa/All-About-Performance/blob/main/ProcessorPerformance/Fibonacci_Recursion/files/tree.png)

We tested this on different platforms; and also the results get better with time (as better
processors get available) as shown in table below.

# **Fibonacci: by Memoization [doing above the faster way! ;) ]**

In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to
speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning
the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

This program
is [here](https://github.com/sigmakappa/All-About-Performance/blob/main/ProcessorPerformance/Fibonacci_Recursion/Fibonacci_using_maps.py)

I'll keep adding more results as tested on different platforms. Please feel free to send
results from your machine too (and please don't forget to add your machine configurations).
Thanks in advance.

NOTE: All observations based on Python 3.8/3.9 (except stated otherwise).

## **Instructions for carrying out the above experiment:**

1. While the process is running, make sure nothing else is executed/running by the user that takes up the processor.
2. The observations can easily be obtained by running the experiment for one weekend on a machine (~48 hours).
